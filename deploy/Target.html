                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>As a team, we worked collaboratively to help improve the experience for the Target™ Team Members. In a time of
                        Social Distancing, Guest Experience is key and in high demand; for Target™ Team Members, being
                        able to complete an order for a Guest Pick-Up is crucial, especially when Target™ receives 200-400 Drive Up
                        Orders per day.</p>
                    <p>By improving the quality of Target™&#39;s Curbside Pick-up and implementing a socially distant Cubby System
                        for guests — this not only helps Target™ Team Members feel safe but also improves the quality of customer
                        service for Team Members while continuing to give back to the community.</p>

                    <h3>Design Concept</h3>
                    <p>During our in-class breakout session, we discussed our collective desire to work on designing a prototype for
                        an app that is different from the class project prompt of an Expedia competitor or another hotel booking
                        company. As a team, we liked the example of the class prompt&#39;s competitor edge — “COVID related”. With the
                        current state of the global pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions, our team thought it would great to
                        support the lives of millions of people with a digital product that solves an everyday problem; a
                        contactless shopping experience. We started brainstorming potential companies like food delivery services.
                        However, we decided to go in a different direction since many of our cohort&#39;s previous in-class assignments
                        revolved around companies like Door Dash and Uber Eats.</p>
                    <p>After sharing personal experiences with our own contactless shopping experiences, we decided to move forward
                        with a contactless shopping experience theme. We were able to narrow down our ideal company from food
                        delivery to grocery delivery to a company that would combine both. We started looking at larger retailers
                        that can provide curbside pick up for daily household essentials as well. We decided as a team that Target™
                        what be a great company to work on to study and improve their curbside shopping experience.</p>

                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>As the world comes to a pause and masks are becoming the new norm, curbside pickup has revolutionized the way
                        society does retail and grocery shopping.</p>
                    <p>Knowing this, Team IV&#39;s goal for the design is to improve the quality and safety of their Target™ Team
                        Members. As a Target™ Team Member, it can be difficult to fulfill a Curbside Pick-up Order when you&#39;re
                        not
                        notified of the Guest&#39;s order status. As a collective, we&#39;ve come up with the Target™ Tracker to
                        simplify and
                        ease the process of fulfilling orders as employees deal with large volumes of orders throughout the day.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the Target™ Tracker, we&#39;ve added a Cubby Feature to separate Guests&#39; orders along with
                        a
                        Curbside Preference Feature for Guests to select their contactless delivery method to their vehicle to
                        social distance as much as possible during this unconventional time.</p>
                    <h3>How Might We Question</h3>
                    <p>Additionally, we&#39;ve come up with the How Might We Question which states, <strong>How might we enhance the
                            ease of fulfilling Drive-Up (curbside pick up) orders for Target™ employees like Target™ Travis?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>What does success look like? Identify the key points that the user will use on your product as their
                        achievement. Highlight goals your designs should meet at the end of the project.</p>

                    <p>As a designer and accessibility specialist, I had the privilege of vocally advocating for a higher standard
                        of design for Target™ employees in our MVP Target™ Drive Up prototype. Throughout the project, I urged
                        everyone to think more critically about the users, who they were, and what they&#39;d need to see at-a-glance on
                        this application.</p>
                    <p>Key decisions I made as a UX/UI Designer were:</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Scoured the Target™ website for all typefaces, colors, iconography, etc.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>After user feedback from usability tests and several in-group debates, redid the key/legend for the
                                cubbies so that employees are more quickly and better informed about cubby state</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>After learning that Target™&#39;s myDevices are android based, I advocated for Material Design System to
                                be a base for our design system</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Added the shopper&#39;s profile on the top of most screens so that employees are aware of who they&#39;re

                    <p><strong>Business Problem:</strong> Target employees are not able to track in real-time what phase a
                        shopper&#39;s
                        order is in when fulfilling a curbside pickup order.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Designing the Target™ Tracker for Target™ employees to track their fulfillment of
                        Target™&#39;s Drive Up orders — modeled after the Domino™&#39;s Pizza Tracker.</p>
                    <p><strong>Unique Value Proposition:</strong> Team IV wanted to stick with a proposition that rang true to
                        Target™'s existing tagline: "Expect More. Pay Less." EXPECT MORE of the same great shopping experience
                        inside the TARGET™ app with curbside pick up that&#39;s easy and CONTACT LESS with the ability to TRACK

                    <h2>Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
                    <p>As a team, our brainstorming methods were crazy 8 and user flow diagrams. Our key goals for the design was to
                        make it user-friendly at first glance, validating the employee&#39;s needs through gratification while
                        keeping
                        the brand loyaty of Target&#39;s signature color scheme.</p>
                    <p>Below showcases our process sketches of low-fidelity wireframes:</p>
                    <div class="gap-v gap-h gallery-1-col">
                        <ul class="gap-v gap-h gallery-2-col">

                    </div>
                    <p>The prototype was designed within the Target employee app and website. The goal of the design was to maintain
                        the brand loyalty by preserving Target&#39;s orginal color scheme, iconography, and typography referenced by
                        the
                        Target website.</p>
                    <p>The Target team uses myDevices through Android&#39;s operating platform. As a team, we maintained
                        Target&#39;s
                        Material Design elements while implimenting additionals to the design system such as the social distant
                        curbside and cubby feature. Once the prototype was discussed and refined, the team presented the design
                        system to a series of users for additional feedback.</p>

                    <h3>High Fidelity Designs</h3>
                    <p>Utilizing our style guide and the Material Design System was our team designed sections of the Target Travis
                        workflow to create High-Fidelity wireframes that were based on scenes from the team’s Crazy 8’s sketches of
                        Target Travis’s curbside fulfillment workflow. The goal of the high-fidelity wireframes is to iterate on
                        the low-fidelity wireflows with more detailed features like color, components unique to our design,
                        transofrmation of the wireframes into a clickable prototype. The Target Tracker feature also received the
                        high fidelity treatment and further tests the idea of a user’s ability to track curbside orders in real time
                        with live clickable actions. The prototype accomplishes a workflow that is less labor-intensive and helps
                        Target Travis fill curbside orders more efficiently.</p>
                    <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                    <p>During testing, we came across a handful of glitches that needed to be patched and reworked. The most notable
                        changes that needed to be made were that the Tracker needed to be moved elsewhere from being pinned on the
                        top of the screen which cause the Tracker to be unobtrusive to users. As well as, recreating and reworking
                        the cubby’s legend/key so that it’s more comprehensive to the users. Now that we’ve completed our newest
                        iteration, we’d like to re-test the prototype amongst a more focused group, primarily consisting of
                        employees who would be theoretically using this application.</p>
                    <h3>Insight & Revisions</h3>
                    <p>This section highlights consolidated insights and revisions as a team and the feedback that was collected

                            <p>Reducing the number of instant gratification screens in order to simplify our flow and cut down
                                real-time for the users.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Beginning Flow Was Redundant</strong></p>
                            <p>We simplified the sign in flow to offer two user experiences; one with a full login experience and
                                one with a simplified experience that allows a user to begin orders after being prompted from a
                                notification.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Reselected Cubby Colors</strong></p>
                            <p>Keeping in mind the stoplight method, We changed our colors so users wouldn’t associate certain
                                colors with their own subconscious thinking. We added differentiators on the cubbies and key
                                patterns to accommodate those whom might have disabilities.</p>

                            <p><strong>Redesigning the Target Tracker</strong></p>
                            <p>Throughout our Usability Testing, users were missing the Target Tracker up at the top of the flow;
                                so, we’ve moved it down and added animation to each target tracker as it changes phases to call the
                                user’s attention.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Implemented Animations to the Target Tracker</strong></p>
                            <p>As a team, when faced with users omission of the Target Tracker in its original state, we’ve designed
                                animations as a focal point to the user; this brought up a good point of Accessibility for those
                                with sensitivity to blinking lights that might potentially cause seizures in the workplace.</p>

                    <h3>Color</h3>
                    <p>We utilized the official Target Red as the primary color to make the prototype feel more real. The white and
                        off-white that Target uses as backgrounds was used as backgrounds in the prototype as well, but on top of
                        that it was repurposed for neutral “empty” states for elements such as chips and cubbies. We also use two
                        different greens in a different way that Target uses them. We use the brighter and more saturated green for
                        success or confirmation buttons, and the darker green for success states that are just to notify the
                        employees that something went well, such as snackbars and checkmarks. We repurposed the Target Clearance
                        yellow to be more informative. It’s used for the map’s route throughout the store, as well as a snackbar
                        state to tell the employee they have scanned the wrong item.</p>

                    <h3>Typography</h3>
                    <p>Through our research and looking through Target’s website, it seems they use a proprietary typeface called
                        Targetica — a modified version of Helvetica to suit Target’s needs. Since we could not get our hands on the
                        typeface, we used Open Sans — a Google Font that has similar qualities to Targetica, and if this app is
                        implemented into Target’s employees’ routines, then naturally we can assume that the typeface would be
                        switched out.</p>
                    <p>We decided to use Open Sans at a low contrasting type scale. It’s a purely utilitarian application. Having a
                        small type scale allows users to have more information to be present on the screen. For accessibility
                        purposes we set the minimum body size to be 18px. There are notable exceptions throughout the prototype with
                        smaller text sizes, such as captions and overline. </p>

                        employees and customers on the same page.</p>

                        website, therefore we went through Target’s website and reused the illustrations.</p>

                        other project, we needed to create custom components. To add some friendliness to the prototype, most
                        elements have rounded corners (buttons, cubby selections, chips, etc.).</p>
