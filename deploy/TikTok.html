                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Since mid-2017, TikTok has gained explosive popularity globally, but especially in the United States. TikTok
                        is one of the world&#39;s most popular social media platforms for short-form (15–60 seconds) video creation and
                        sharing. The attraction to TikTok is that anyone can create whatever they&#39;d like, with each video
                        potentially becoming someone&#39;s “15 minutes of fame.”</p>
                    <p>While conducting research, a pattern arose that most people on the app want a sense of community. That led me
                        to TikTok&#39;s Live Stream section. It has the most potential for growth into this conduit for community
                        that people crave.</p>

            <section id="ttProblem" class="section-content article-text">
                <article class="gap-v gap-h">
                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>Based on preliminary research, there was a clear lack of community between Content Creators and Viewers that
                        both user types very much craved. So, the problem I set out to solve was: <strong>how to rethink TikTok&#39;s Live
                            Stream functionality so that there&#39;s better engagement between Content Creators and their Viewers.</strong>
                        Currently, the only form of engagement on Live Streams relies solely on comments and a basic form of
                        donations to the Content Creator streaming. Depending on the popularity of the Creator and how many people
                        are watching the stream, the comments section usually is filled up with Viewers asking questions or just
                        trying to get the Content Creator to give them a shoutout.</p>
                    <p>An alternative way to give the comments section a brief pause is to donate to the Content Creator because
                        they will see that and generally thank whoever donates to them, especially when it comes to higher-priced
                        donations.</p>

                    <h2>Audience</h2>
                    <p>Since TikTok has set a minimum age of 18 years old for receiving and giving donations, the audience&#39;s age in
                        this study focused on that demographic, as well as a few self-imposed rules. Using my screener survey, I set
                        out to find people who are on TikTok at least once every other day. I also searched for those who have
                        donated money to Creators, either through TikTok itself or other means such as Venmo, CashApp, Patreon, etc.

                    <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>Since I worked alone, I led both the UX Research and UX Design initiatives. The initiatives were split up
                        between 8 weeks of research and another 8 on design and usability testing. The first 8 weeks were spent on
                        Discovery Research and Competitive Analyses, Interviewing both Content Creators and Viewers to see if common
                        patterns arose, and User Personas. I wanted to understand how people view and use TikTok as it is currently
                        created. The next 8 weeks were used for developing a solution through User Journey Maps, Lightning Demos,
                        Crazy 8 sketches, Wireframing, Branding, Prototyping, Usability Testing, and finally redesigning the
                        wireframes based on the results of the Usability Tests.</p>

                    <h2>Scope and Constraints</h2>
                    <p>The initial discovery research and design phases were each eight weeks long. Since the project&#39;s scope was
                        for academic purposes, I did not reach out to TikTok. As both phases took place during the COVID-19 pandemic
                        and subsequent lockdowns, in-person interviews were not possible and were strictly replaced by Zoom meetings
                        (with screen sharing when necessary).</p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <h3>Discovery Research</h3>
                    <p>The competitive analysis was used to bring to the surface what made TikTok different than its competitors.
                        The most popular of the six direct and indirect competitors were Byte Inc. and Instagram.</p>
                    <p>Byte Inc., or just Byte, is the successor to the popular app from 2013, Vine. It&#39;s similar in the sense
                        that
                        you can create short 15 second looped videos and share/ “Re-Byte” them. Byte also has a feed of random
                        creators based on your likes known as the Your Mix page (similar to TikTok&#39;s For You page). Due to
                        Byte&#39;s
                        overwhelming similarity to TikTok, there are a fair amount of reviews in Apple&#39;s App Store that call
                        Byte a
                        “backup of TikTok” in case it was ever taken off the US App Store, as well as a “TikTok knockoff”.</p>
                    <p>With 1 billion monthly active users globally, Instagram is one of the world&#39;s most popular social media
                        applications. It&#39;s a platform to share photos, videos, stories, and live stream to one&#39;s followers.
                        Its
                        popularity can be pointed towards the fact that anyone can pick it up and learn how to use it. Instagram
                        also has nearly infinite topics to explore. On top of this, the stickers people can put on their story were
                        one of the most referenced pieces of media that five out of the six initial interviewees mentioned and
                        discussed at some point during the discovery phase&#39;s interviews.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the interviews, the main topic that kept resurfacing is that people want more of a sense of
                        community that just isn&#39;t there in TikTok as of right now. Viewers want to be able to talk to and learn
                        more
                        about their favorite Creators, and Content Creators want to hear feedback from their audience.</p>
                    <h3>How Might We</h3>
                    <p>The research and competitive analysis led to the question: <strong>How might we rethink TikTok&#39;s Live
                            Stream
                            functionality so that there&#39;s better engagement between the Content Creators and their
                            audience?</strong></p>
            
                    <h3>User Journey Map</h3>
                    <p>The User Journey Map helped me focus on the important parts of the Live Stream and narrow down what I wanted
                        to work on. It&#39;s important to note that all the essential parts of the Live Stream occur in the yellow
                        area.</p>

                    <h3>Lightning Demo and Crazy 8's</h3>
                    <p>After narrowing down the focus on the Live Stream to just three aspects, I sketched out potential additions
                        and redesigns based on other applications. I took the Pinned Comment suggestion from the research phase and
                        took inspiration from Instagram Live’s pinned comment design. I also drew Twitch’s “bits” donation drawer as
                        that was one of the few popular applications that allow donations during a live stream. Lastly, I really
                        liked how YouTube filtered their Live Chats. Between being able to watch comments in real-time, or switching
                        it to the top chats (filtering spam, solicitations, etc.) seemed like a good idea for TikTok to prevent
                        viewers from serial posting the same message repeatedly for attention from the Content Creator.</p>

                    <p>After the initial sketches, I made a set of Crazy 8 sketches (pictured below). The best idea was the top
                        right-most sketch. All the future iterations were based on that concept.</p>

                    <h2>Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
                    <h3>After sketching ideas, I narrowed down which concepts I wanted to incorporate into TikTok&#39;s Live Stream
                        functionality. I landed on the donation feature, where Viewers can donate money to the Content Creator
                        they&#39;re currently watching.</h3>
                    <p>The competitive analysis was used to bring to the surface what made TikTok different than its competitors.
                        The most popular of the six direct and indirect competitors were Byte Inc. and Instagram.</p>

                        alt="Series of four frames outlining the stages of opening a TikTok livestream and the process of donating money to a content creator">
                    <p>Compared to the current donation flow, not much has changed as it is as bare-bones as one can make it, in my
                        opinion. But what can change is how easy it is accessed and how decisions to donate are made. I rounded the
                        corners of nearly everything to add a sense of friendliness, made buttons bigger to make them seem even more
                        prominent, and moved the “recharge” button to refill coins in a more prominent area that&#39;s closer to the
                        Thumb Zone. I then used <a
                            href="https://shawnw972039.invisionapp.com/console/share/HS1UK6Q832">Craft/InVision</a> to prototype it
                        and set it up for Usability Testing.</p>
                    <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                    <p>I sent out screener surveys and ended up with five participants, all of whom are Viewers. Three participants
                        frequently watch TikToks daily, and the other two go on TikTok for roughly 2&#8722;4 hours weekly. Three
                        have
                        previously donated money to Content Creators, either through TikTok itself or through Venmo, CashApp,
                        Patreon, etc. Due to limited responses on the survey, all Viewers infrequently watch Live Streams, and not
                        for very long if they do. Each participant was given a list of tasks to complete. (1) To open the live
                        stream, (2) Refill the number of coins in their account, (3) Then donate money to their favorite creator,
                        and (4) Undo the donation if they would like (optional).</p>
                    <p>My assumptions entering the tests were: People don&#39;t trust TikTok enough to donate through their
                        platform,
                        and if people perceive TikTok to be less aggressive, they&#39;ll be more likely to donate.</p>
                    <p>For the Open Live Stream screen, most people opened the Live Stream before I was able to ask or mention
                        anything, which made me believe that it was intuitive, at least on some level. The Recharge Drawer screen
                        had several points for feedback. One participant mentioned to “<em>change the phrase [“Recharge”]. It
                            reminds me
                            too much of video games and how I need to recharge my health or stamina.</em>” It is currently the copy
                        that
                        TikTok uses, and this participant was the only one who commented on this, so I didn&#39;t change it.</p>
                    <p>Another participant said, “<em>I like the height of the [drawers], but I wish they were a little bit lower
                            down so I can see more of the live stream.</em>” A second participant stated a similar suggestion. This
                        viewer also suggested that I at least add a photo of what a Live Stream would look like as opposed to a
                        blank room for reference for how high the drawers should go. I ended up lowering the drawers so that more of
                        the Stream is visible to the Viewer.</p>
                    <p>For the Gift Drawer screen, one participant recommended reordering the illustrations. The recommendation was
                        that the illustrations should be organized based on how elaborate the animations would be when played
                        on-screen when the Viewer selected them. I reorganized the illustrations based on exactly that. Another
                        stated that they didn’t know what gifts did, and suggested adding a help button to bring up a page to
                        explain it all. Because of that I added a help button, as well as changed the lightning symbol for
                        “Recharge” to the local currency so it would be less confusing.</p>

                    <h2>Branding</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to change TikTok&#39;s branding a little bit. I changed its personality to be fun and playful, but
                        takes
                        a step back to allow Content Creators a space to make engaging videos for their audience. TikTok is
                        cheerful, encouraging, and wholesome. Due to the diversity of content and diversity of audience members,
                        there are a plethora of videos made by Content Creators, so there is a little bit of something for
                        everybody.</p>
                    <h3>Voice</h3>
                    <p>For its voice I wanted TikTok to be upbeat, patient, and down-to-earth. Its voice is neutral and instructive
                        when it comes to more intensive sections of the app, such as editing. For example, to add a comment the copy
                        is “<em>Share your thoughts…</em>”. The current copy to make a new video is “<em>Tap to create a new
                            video</em>”, but since TikTok, the name of the company, has been adopted colloquially for the short-form
                        videos on the platform, the copy would now read “<em>Make a new TikTok!</em>”</p>
                    <h3>Color</h3>
                    <p>Visually, I wanted the app to strictly be dark mode, because if someone is staring at this app, it&#39;s less
                        stressful on the eyes. The dark navy blue is TikTok&#39;s primary color. It&#39;s used for main components,
                        such as
                        buttons and text on light backgrounds. The more royal blue is TikTok&#39;s secondary color, used for
                        components
                        and text that don&#39;t require as much attention, such as overlays. The banana-yellow is for TikTok&#39;s
                        CTAs and
                        areas that demand one&#39;s attention. The bright white is mainly used for text on dark backgrounds and
                        affordances to teach one how to use the app.</p>

                        face adds a feeling of helpful instruction for people to latch onto.</p>

                    <h2>Outcomes and Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Based on what I had learned, my assumption that friendliness would play a big role in the likelihood of
                        someone to donate was validated. Most participants said that the ease of use as well as the “vibe” they got
                        would make them more likely to donate to Creators. My personal bias points that towards the heavily rounded
                        corners and large colorful illustrations. By taking these factors into consideration, participants felt a
                        greater sense of community through the enhanced interaction with the redesigned flow for Viewers to donate
                        to Content Creators.</p>
