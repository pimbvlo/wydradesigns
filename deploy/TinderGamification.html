                <article class="gap-v gap-h">
                    <p>Since its founding in 2012, Tinder has evolved dating apps into a game based on one&#39;s superficial
                        judgment.
                        Nine years later, it&#39;s one of the world&#39;s most popular dating apps with an estimated 66 million
                        monthly
                        active users (MAU). (Statista) 50% of those MAU are members of Gen Z, ages 18 to 25. (“Tinder Newsroom —
                        About Tinder”) Tinder broke the online dating mold and strayed away from the traditional way dating sites
                        functioned. “Online dating sites… frequently offer users more than just a handful of profiles for
                        side-by-side comparison. Indeed, they often present users with nearly simultaneous access to (the profiles
                        of) many potential partners, sometimes thousands of them, who vary in complex ways across a wide range of
                        characteristics.” (Finkel et al.) The way Tinder functions is seemingly simpler than traditional dating
                        sites. The user makes a profile with their photo, adds a blurb about themselves, sets the setting for who
                        they want to potentially meet, and then they&#39;re ready to start. They swipe right on someone to Like them
                        and
                        swipe left to Pass. If someone they “swiped right” on Likes them back, then it&#39;s considered a Match, and
                        then the two can start chatting. This “double opt-in” method is primarily how Tinder broke away from
                        traditional sites. (Tinder) The way Tinder shows profiles to the users is that it calculates a user&#39;s
                        Elo
                        score weighed against a user&#39;s (who Likes them) own Elo score. “The more right swipes that person had,
                        the
                        more their right swipe on you meant for your score.” (Tiffany) Tinder then shows the user other profiles
                        that have similar scores. This is the old way Tinder works, but the new algorithm works in a very similar
                        way, just without an official ranking associated with each users&#39; profile. (Tiffany)</p>
                    <h2>How Tinder Works</h2>
                    <h3>Gamification</h3>
                    <p>The new game-like features, such as the swiping, the Boosts, Rewinds, and Super Likes and the anticipation of
                        a Match, are what gamified the dating app beyond just looking at someone else&#39;s profile. This is a
                        process
                        known as Gamification, “the process of adding games or gamelike elements to something to encourage
                        participation.” (“Gamification”) It&#39;s a popular tactic in most industries to make activities fun and to
                        encourage people to get involved. It&#39;s not a new concept, but it has exploded over the last several
                        years.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tinder is, generally speaking, a free app. But, it also has three tiers of monthly or annual plans aside from
                        its basic free plan, each having its unique perks, for those who want a little extra help. The basic paid
                        plan is Tinder Plus, then Tinder Gold, where you can see who Liked you before you even start swiping, and,
                        their most expensive plan, Tinder Platinum, which you can message someone before even Matching with them.
                        (Tinder) As of Q3 of 2020, 10% of the 66 million MAU are paid subscribers, regardless of plan. (Statista)
                        Non-paying users have a limit of 50 Likes every 12 hours, and every paid tier has an unlimited amount of
                        Likes. On top of that, free users are bombarded with “reminders&#39;&#39; that they can pay for a plan to
                        remove the
                        cap on Likes, as well as sporadic interruptions where users can purchase Boosts/Super Boosts and Super
                        Likes. Boosts/Super Boosts are a way to get around Tinder&#39;s Elo-like algorithm to put oneself “ahead of
                        the
                        line”, for a limited amount of time. Boosts promise 10 times more profile views, and Super Boosts promise up
                        to 100 times more profiles. It is worth noting that at the time of writing this, Super Boosts aren&#39;t
                        available everywhere right now, it&#39;s only available in select areas. (Tinder) In January 2021 alone,
                        Tinder
                        made 64.62 million USD. (Statista)</p>
                    <h3>Psychology</h3>
                    <p>Jeff Johnson, author of Designing with the Mind in Mind, has defined the Sunk Cost Fallacy as a “tendency to
                        stick with a decision and even put more resources into a losing cause.” (Johnson 208) People feel that the
                        more they put into something, they should be getting back an equal or higher return on their investment.
                        They don&#39;t want to feel that their time was, effectively, wasted. Such as when they are purchasing plans
                        or
                        individual Boosts or Super Likes. The IKEA Effect plays a similar role to the Sunk Cost Fallacy within the
                        realm of dating and dating apps. Johnson describes the IKEA Effect as valuing things more after an effort is
                        put into them. (Johnson 208) When users put in more money and time into swiping, or even just talking to
                        those they Matched with, they internally place more value on the app or on the individual. The way that the
                        payment is structured on Tinder, through these microtransactions, is the same structure that mobile games
                        use. Microtransactions are:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p><em>Commonly refers to a business model… where users can purchase virtual goods via micropayments…
                                Microtransactions (i.e., premium content) may include downloadable content such as story extensions
                                (so
                                called 'DLCs'), additional play time, levels, new maps, virtual currency, weapons, armor,
                                characters, or
                                cosmetic items to customize the player&#39;s character or items. The player pays… directly with real
                                world
                                currency or with some form of fantasy virtual currency (e.g., gold). (Schwiddessen and Karius
                                18)</em></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Keller Gordon explains that “Certain microtransactions fall somewhere in between cosmetic enhancements and
                        pay-to-win… While these in-game purchases can&#39;t give you an edge against an opponent, they affect where
                        you fall in the rankings.” (Gordon) The virtual goods that these Tinder Plus/Gold/Platinum users are paying
                        for
                        are the chance to put their faces in front of people for the potential chance to Match with them by using
                        Super Likes and Boosts and by removing the 50 Likes cap. But, if people aren&#39;t receiving those matches,
                        the Sunk Cost Fallacy states that they&#39;re highly likely to pay for more “Tinder DLC.” And the more they
                        pay,
                        the more likely they are to stay on the metaphorical “sinking ship”.</p>
                    <p>If we consider the brain chemistry that plays into this, we can see how the mix of the Sunk Cost Fallacy and
                        Tinder ends up potentially creating an addiction. In Dr. Robert Sapolsky&#39;s talk, he speaks about the
                        dopamine levels between the Signal, Work, and Reward. Most people would expect that the highest point of
                        dopamine would be once the subject gets the reward, but, the converse was true as the study went on. The
                        highest levels of dopamine were recorded between the Signal and Work, showing that the reward was
                        effectively meaningless and that it&#39;s all about the anticipation of the reward. Meaning, that people
                        keep
                        chasing after the anticipation of the reward (especially when that reward is unpredictable), and once
                        obtained, they just want that anticipation once more. (Sapolsky) (Henderson, and Schrader) This is easily
                        viewed within Tinder and the structure of the app. The Signal is the user sending out Likes/Passes for the
                        potential to get Match, which is the reward. The Work is the other users doing the same thing for other
                        people. Effectively, when the user is swiping left or right, they are the Signal for themselves, and the
                        Work for others, both of whom are working to be each others&#39; Match/Reward. So, if people keep searching
                        for
                        that anticipation, they&#39;re even more inclined to purchase more Boosts, Super Likes, or even different
                        paid
                        tiers.</p>
                    <p>The Sunk Cost Fallacy also applies to what happens even after people Match, when they are in a relationship.
                        People tend to stay in relationships for a little while after they should, specifically due to the Sunk Cost
                        Fallacy. Due to the IKEA Effect, they also place a higher value on the relationship because of the time and
                        effort that they have put into it. They feel that because of that, it&#39;s worth sticking it out a little
                        longer, even if they&#39;re unhappy. (Gander) Based on several conflicting sources, the average person is a
                        part
                        3 to 12 different relationships before marriage. According to Tinder, the app averages 1.5 million dates per
                        week and has had 60+ billion total Matches. (“Tinder Newsroom — About Tinder”) There is no definite number,
                        but it&#39;s easy to conclude that not every first date leads to relationships. There will always be awkward
                        first dates, and one-night stands, so those users will most likely stay on Tinder. But the ones that lead to
                        relationships will statistically lead some users back to Tinder after a breakup. So the Sunk Cost Fallacy
                        keeps users on Tinder, and those that end up in relationships will most likely bring them back to Tinder or
                        another dating app/site (just to even try a different one).</p>
                    <h3>Design Implications</h3>
                    <p>The more user-friendly design implications of this research are to intentionally “slow down” the app.
                        It&#39;s a
                        common trend on Tinder and other dating apps for people to start swiping out of boredom, so putting
                        metaphorical speed bumps in their way will break up the habituation, or the “repeated exposure to the same
                        perceptions [that] dulls our perceptual system&#39;s sensitivity to them.” (Johnson 4) If there is a way to
                        count swipes per second, then after a certain amount of swipes there should be a modal pop-up telling the
                        user to “slow down and smell the roses” by looking at the photos of those they&#39;re swiping on or to look
                        at
                        their photos.</p>
                    <p>Because Tinder&#39;s parent company is Match Group, it can potentially learn from other intellectual property
                        owned by the same parent company. Hinge is another popular dating app. It self proclaims to be “designed to
                        be deleted,” meaning it understands that it&#39;s only supposed to be temporary in that it encourages its
                        users
                        to make real connections with their matches. Its draw is the fact that it forces the user to pick something
                        from the person&#39;s profile that they like or can talk about, and send the potential match a message about
                        said topic. (“What Is Hinge?”) It breaks up the habituation by forcing the user to make an intentional
                        decision on each profile they come across.</p>
                    <p>On the business side of the app, Mr. Gary Swidler, the chief financial officer (CFO), of Match Group said,
                        “You get a huge advantage by getting a lot of free users.” He explained that the more people that sign up
                        for Tinder, the more people who will potentially pay for the “Tinder DLC” later down the line. (Bromwich)
                        Each new user is offered a 3-day free trial to Tinder Gold, but extending that timing to a week could lead
                        to more subscriptions further down the road since the users would have had more time to get used to those
                        perks, then realize the limitations of the free version of the app.</p>
                    <p>Since Tinder is one of the leading dating apps worldwide and has already revolutionized how dating apps work,
                        it can also re-revolutionize how relationships can stay together. It&#39;s not out of the realm of
                        possibility
                        that Tinder could also create a section of the app for couples or even a companion app for those who are
                        already in relationships. Adding in a way for couples to meet, or to create randomized date night
                        suggestions that would encourage couples to stay together, and adds a potential new source of subscriptions
                        and revenue for Tinder.</p>
                    <p>Tinder broke the mold by gamifying dating apps. They created the concept of swiping on people&#39;s profiles
                        in
                        order to have the double opt-in to form Matches. They also added different tiers of perks for users to
                        purchase. Those microtransactions, combined with the psychology behind the Sunk Cost Fallacy and the
                        dopamine rush in the anticipation of Matches, means that Tinder has made the perfect app to keep users on
                        their platform, for better or worse.</p>
