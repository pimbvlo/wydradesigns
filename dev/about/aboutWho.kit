        <p>I enjoy working on UX/UI design, branding, and typography, with a focus on accessibility and
            research. I
            would like to <span>help people</span> through design. I love assisting everyone through
            <span>empathic
                design</span> and
            <span>accessibility</span>. Making sure that design is accessible to all ensures that it’s useable
            for
            anyone regardless of circumstance. I believe that <span>good design shouldn’t be obvious</span>. It
            should be a seamless form
            of
            communication between the end product and its users.

        <p>In my free time, I play electric bass, geek out over public transit, and I love to cook. I also love
            going out on adventures with my camera to a new part of whatever area I am in.</p>
