            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <div>
                <p>I enjoy working on UX/UI design, branding, and typography, with a focus on accessibility and research. I would like to <span>help people</span> through design. I love assisting everyone through <span>empathic design</span> and
                    <span>accessibility</span>. Making sure that design is accessible to all ensures that it’s useable for anyone regardless of circumstance. I belive that <span>good design shouldn’t be obvious</span>. It should be a seamless form of
                    communication between the end product and its users.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I play electric bass, geek out over public transit, and I love to cook. I also love going out on adventures with my camera to a new part of whatever area I am in.</p>
