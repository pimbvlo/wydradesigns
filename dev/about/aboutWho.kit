            <p>I enjoy working on UX/UI design, branding, and typography, with a focus on accessibility and
                research. I love assisting everyone through <strong>empathic design</strong> and
                <strong>accessibility</strong>. Making sure that design is accessible to all ensures that it is useable
                for anyone regardless of circumstance. I believe that good design <strong>shouldnâ€™t</strong> be obvious, and
                should be a seamless form of communication between the end product and its users.

            <p>In my free time, I play electric bass, geek out over public transit, and cook new recipes I find out in the
                world or online. I also love going out on adventures with my camera wherever I am.</p>
