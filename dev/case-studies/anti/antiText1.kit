            <p>The box includes a box of sugar, a bottle of bitters, two neat glasses, and two booklets. One booklet is on the history of the old fashioned from the early 1800's to the present. The other booklet is on
                both classic and experimental recipes of Old Fashioneds. I centered the theme of the box based on 19th century advertisement engravings. Keeping with the theme, I wanted a simple black and white design to highlight that Old
                Fashioneds were originally a pushback against showy and swanky cocktails at the time.</p>
