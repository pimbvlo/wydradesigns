            <p>I centered the theme of Antifogmatic around the history that Old Fashioneds were originally a pushback against showy and swanky cocktails at the time. Keeping with the theme, the box is based on 19th century advertisement engravings.
                The box includes a box of sugar, a bottle of bitters, two neat glasses, and two booklets. One booklet is on the history of the old fashioned from the early 1800's to the present. The other booklet is on both classic and experimental
                recipes of Old Fashioneds.</p>
