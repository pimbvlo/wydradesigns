            <p>This piece is of rigid packaging that houses 5 items. The package is supposed to house and protect the contents inside. I decided to build a box that's purpose is to educate and encourage experimentation with the making of an Old
                Fashioned cocktail. The box includes a box of sugar, a bottle of bitters, two neat glasses, and two booklets. One booklet is on the history of the old fashioned from the early 1800's to the present. The other booklet is on both
                classic and experimental recipes of Old Fashioneds. I centered the theme of the box based on 19th century advertisement engravings. Keeping with the theme, I wanted a simple black and white design to highlight that Old Fashioneds were
                originally a pushback against showy and swanky cocktails at the time.</p>
