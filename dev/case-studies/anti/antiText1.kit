        <p>I centered the theme of Antifogmatic around the history that Old Fashion cocktails were originally a
            pushback against "showy" and "swanky" cocktails at the time. In keeping with the theme, the box is based
            on 19th century advertisement engravings. The box includes a box of sugar, a bottle of bitters, two neat
            glasses, and two booklets. One booklet is on the history of the old fashioned from the early 1800's to the
            present. The other booklet is on both
            classic and experimental recipes of Old Fashioneds.</p>
