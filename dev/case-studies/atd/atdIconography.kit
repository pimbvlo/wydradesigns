        <p>Due to the audience being primarily designers, I had leeway with the iconographic language. I utilized the
            universal abstract language of basic shapes that designers of different fields use almost daily. All
            different shapes have the
            same line width with a rounded endcap. Everything is set on a 40pt grid. </p>
        <p>Each field of design has their own specific treatment as well. Print design primarily uses circles and
            halftone patters due to the way ink is printed. Web design has triangles because it is the only sharp shape
            in the library, and due
            to the nature of how screens process SVGs. Environment designâ€™s treatment is unique in that it is primarily
            free-form and overlapping, but with the addition of shading to show depth and volume within the iconography.
