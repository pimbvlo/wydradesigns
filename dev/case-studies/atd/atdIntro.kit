        <p>Attention to Detail was conceptualized from a lack of resources on accessibility within design easily available
            to designers. Accessibility, especially in design, is only ever taught for those pursuing master’s degrees, or
            on the job
            in one’s relevant field, if that. Attention to Detail is only part of an answer to that problem. It’s a resource
            of resources for all designers of every field.</p>
