        <h2>Logo</h2>
        <div class="gallery-2-col gap-v gap-h">
            <p>The logo is built up from elements and stylings inspired by the iconography. The A is a modified outlined
                triangle to make it seem more like the section of an A above the crossbar. The T is just two simple
                lines at
                a perpendicular
                angle. Lastly, the D is the dotted and outlined circle cut in half and extended terminals.</p>
