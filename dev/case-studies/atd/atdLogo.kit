            <p>The logo is built up from elements and stylings inspired by the iconography. The A is a modified outlined triangle to make it seem more like the section of an A above the crossbar. The T is just two simple lines at a perpendicular
                angle. Lastly, the D is the dotted and outlined circle cut in half and extended terminals.</p>
