        <p>For our book design final, we were each given an artist to thoroughly research and immerse ourselves into. I
            was assigned Barbara Kasten, a multidisciplinary artist with pieces using photography, sculpture, diazotype,
            painting, and textiles. I was influenced by her use of patterns and the leading lines throughout her
            photography. I traced focal points of her pieces or extended them from beyond the edge of the work.</p>
