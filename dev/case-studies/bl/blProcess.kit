        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Discovery Research</h3>
        <p>The competitive analysis was used to bring to the surface what made TikTok different than its competitors.
            The most popular of the six direct and indirect competitors were Byte Inc. and Instagram.</p>
        <p>Byte Inc., or just Byte, is the successor to the popular app from 2013, Vine. It&#39;s similar in the sense
            that
            you can create short 15 second looped videos and share/ “Re-Byte” them. Byte also has a feed of random
            creators based on your likes known as the Your Mix page (similar to TikTok&#39;s For You page). Due to
            Byte&#39;s
            overwhelming similarity to TikTok, there are a fair amount of reviews in Apple&#39;s App Store that call
            Byte a
            “backup of TikTok” in case it was ever taken off the US App Store, as well as a “TikTok knockoff”.</p>
        <p>With 1 billion monthly active users globally, Instagram is one of the world&#39;s most popular social media
            applications. It&#39;s a platform to share photos, videos, stories, and live stream to one&#39;s followers.
            Its
            popularity can be pointed towards the fact that anyone can pick it up and learn how to use it. Instagram
            also has nearly infinite topics to explore. On top of this, the stickers people can put on their story were
            one of the most referenced pieces of media that five out of the six initial interviewees mentioned and
            discussed at some point during the discovery phase&#39;s interviews.</p>
        <p>Throughout the interviews, the main topic that kept resurfacing is that people want more of a sense of
            community that just isn&#39;t there in TikTok as of right now. Viewers want to be able to talk to and learn
            more
            about their favorite Creators, and Content Creators want to hear feedback from their audience.</p>
        <h3>How Might We</h3>
        <p>The research and competitive analysis led to the question: <em>How might we rethink TikTok&#39;s Live
                Stream
                functionality so that there&#39;s better engagement between the Content Creators and their
                audience?</em></p>

        <h3>User Journey Map</h3>
        <p>The User Journey Map helped me focus on the important parts of the Live Stream and narrow down what I wanted
            to work on. It&#39;s important to note that all the essential parts of the Live Stream occur in the yellow
            area.</p>

        <h3>Lightning Demo and Crazy 8's</h3>
        <p>After narrowing down the focus on the Live Stream to just three aspects, I sketched out potential additions
            and redesigns based on other applications. I took the Pinned Comment suggestion from the research phase and
            took inspiration from Instagram Live’s pinned comment design. I also drew Twitch’s “bits” donation drawer as
            that was one of the few popular applications that allow donations during a live stream. Lastly, I really
            liked how YouTube filtered their Live Chats. Between being able to watch comments in real-time, or switching
            it to the top chats (filtering spam, solicitations, etc.) seemed like a good idea for TikTok to prevent
            viewers from serial posting the same message repeatedly for attention from the Content Creator.</p>

        <p>After the initial sketches, I made a set of Crazy 8 sketches (pictured below). The best idea was the top
            right-most sketch. All the future iterations were based on that concept.</p>
