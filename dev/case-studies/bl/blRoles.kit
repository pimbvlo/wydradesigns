        <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Since I worked alone, I led both the UX Research and UX Design initiatives. The initiatives were split up
            between 8 weeks of research and another 8 on design and usability testing. The first 8 weeks were spent on
            Discovery Research and Competitive Analyses, Interviewing both Content Creators and Viewers to see if common
            patterns arose, and User Personas. I wanted to understand how people view and use TikTok as it is currently
            created. The next 8 weeks were used for developing a solution through User Journey Maps, Lightning Demos,
            Crazy 8 sketches, Wireframing, Branding, Prototyping, Usability Testing, and finally redesigning the
            wireframes based on the results of the Usability Tests.</p>
