        <p>After meeting the bandmembers and learning about them, the bands' personality felt very solid and
            traditional, so I knew right away that a chunky slab serif typeface was the way to go. Along with that, they
            still have flare, so I wanted to stylize the <i>For</i> to make it feel more in line with some 1920's packaging.
        </p>
        <p>I also wanted to call back to a deck of cards. What better card than the most iconic Ace of Spades! So I flipped the A in <i>Today</i>.</p>

        <p>I chose these colors as they are the same as on a standard deck of playing cards. White as the base card,
            black for spades and clubs, and red for diamonds and hearts. In one of our review calls, I jokingly asked if
            the bandmembers knew about how some decks used to come with a <a
                href="https://deckofshields.com/five-suit-decks/">fifth suit</a>, but we agreed that adding a fourth
            color would just complicate the design further.</p>
