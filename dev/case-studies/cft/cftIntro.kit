        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>After meeting with the band, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cardsfortoday/">Cards for Today</a>, I
            learned the origin behind their name. Med students use a program called <a
                href="https://www.ama-assn.org/medical-students/usmle-step-1-2/what-anki">Anki Cards</a>, and a phrase
            they use with each other is "What's in the <i>cards for today</i>?" So the idea of the star from Anki Cards
            branding,
            as well as the classic 4 suit card deck inspired me.</p>
