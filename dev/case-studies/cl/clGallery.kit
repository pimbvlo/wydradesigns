                    <p>This is a poster designed from and about Clarendon and its history as if it was a lecture series. I created fictitious lectures and their respective descriptions. I decided to model the poster after the woodblock type of the
                        1860's when the typeface was created. I was originally influenced by the glyphs and punctuation of posters of the time, especially the pointing fingers and exclamation mark. I expanded upon the exclamation point, and it became
                        a modular grid.
