        <p>I recently started learning to play electric bass and became interested in researching more about the overall
            Fender Precision brand. I learned that it no longer has physical stores, but rather utilizes distributors
            such as
            Guitar Center. I’ve reimagined what Fender’s store knockdown packaging could look like today. I measured all
            the boxes based around the commonly purchased accessories and parts in their inventory. The smaller boxes
            hold items such as guitar picks and keychains. The larger box design is based on the sizing of straps,
            strings and pickups. The bag is designed to hold several sized boxes and a graphic tee.</p>
