                    <p>I created knockdown packaging for an existing company. At this point I had just started learning how to play electric bass, namely a Fender Precision. When researching the company, I learned that, though Fender has brand
                        guidelines for packaging and bags, it has no physical stores to sell them through. So I did this through the lens that Fender has stores again.</p>

                    <p>I picked the sizing of the boxes and bags based on the accessories and parts you can buy through their online store. The larger box is based around the sizing of straps, strings, and the sizes of pickups. The smaller box is
                        meant to store guitar picks, and keychains. The bag itself is big enough to hold several sized boxes, as well as the graphic tees that they sell too.</p>
