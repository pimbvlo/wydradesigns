            <p>While keeping Fenderâ€™s original brand guidelines in mind, I aimed to create something fresh. I found myself inspired by the British Punk movement and music. After multiple passes and refinements, this inspiration came through to a few
                simple ideas: large fields of color, the Fender logo tucked into the corner, but visible enough to be noticeable, and an emphasis on the musicians themselves. In 2020, Telecaster celebrated their 50th anniversary so honoring that with
                a special edition packaging line became a focal point.</p>
