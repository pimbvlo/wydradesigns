        <p>While keeping Fender’s original brand guidelines in mind, I aimed to create something fresh. I found myself
            inspired by the British Punk movement and music. After multiple passes and refinements, this inspiration
            came through to a few
            simple ideas: large fields of color, the Fender logo tucked into the corner, but visible enough to be
            noticeable, and an emphasis on the musicians themselves. In 2020, Telecaster celebrated their 50th
            anniversary so honoring that with
            a special edition packaging line became a focal point.</p>
