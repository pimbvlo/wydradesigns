                    <p>The purpose of the fictional company, Movebo, is to educate climbers new and old, and help climbers make informed decisions. They educate on whether or not to climb indoors or outdoors, what gear to get, and even techniques.
                        The color palette is based on nature with its varying shades of brown. The blob imagery was created to emulate rock holds of indoor rock walls. <br>See the site <a href="web3/Climbing/deploy/index.html">here</a>.</p>
