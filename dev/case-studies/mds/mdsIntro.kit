        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Meraki Design System (Meraki) is a design system for internal websites, tools, and for external facing mobile
            apps. In 2023, Pfizer went through a rebrand for all print materials. The Customer Experience Design team
            was engaged to create a digital library as a companion to follow the new brand guidelines for all digital
            products. Pfizer has over 74 markets under its umbrella, and this became our guiding light.</p>
        <p>The Customer Experiene team already had Helix Design System, but sadly had to be retired due to a tech stack
            migration. From my work in Meraki Design System, we have saved $31m cumulative cost savings across the work
            of 1,000 developers and designers both internal and external. I was able to reduce time-to-market by
            nearly 50% and non-content related tasks by 35%.</p>
        <h4>I found this using the formula: &lpar;designer + dev working hours&rpar; &#215; &lpar;designer + dev
            rate&rpar;</h4>

        <p><em>How might we upgrade the foundations of an existing Design System for all brands to be customizable and
                repeatable?</em></p>
