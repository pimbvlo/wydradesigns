        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Meraki Design System (Meraki) is a design system for internal websites, tools, and for external facing mobile
            apps. In 2023, Pfizer went through a rebrand for all print materials.
            The Customer Experience Design team was engaged to create a digital library as a companion to follow the new
            brand guidelines for all digital products.
            Pfizer has over 300 brands under its umbrella, and this became our guiding light.

        <p><em>How might we upgrade the foundations of an existing Design System for all brands to be customizable and repeatable?</em></p>
