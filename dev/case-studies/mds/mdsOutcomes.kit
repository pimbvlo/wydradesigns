        <h2>Outcomes and Lessons</h2>
        <p>Since creating new features, we've saved 53k work hours and over 398k component inserts. My focus now lies in
            covering additional product areas across Pfizer while fitting end-user expectations of a modern design
            system.</p>
        <p>Internally, I was a
            founding member of the Zenith team, a spin-off design kit for marketing websites. I helped shape their
            foundations as
            well based on my findings for Meraki.</p>
        <h3>Future Features</h3>
        <p>Utilizing this file and new set of foundations, we've been able to expand the breadth of what we offer. On
            top of the core Design System file, I've spearheaded the initiative to include a Patterns & Templates kit,
            AI kit, Data Visualization kit, Dashboard kit, with a mobile app kit on the way.</p>
        <p>With Figma offering new tools and features every year, I'm especially excited to see what Extended
            Collections will look like when applied to a design system. I've been looking forward to something like this
            in Figma for a while, especially since we can't add formulas to variables just yet. 😉</p>
