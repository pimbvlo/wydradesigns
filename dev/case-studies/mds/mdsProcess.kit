        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Tokens</h3>
        <p>The internal announcement of a rebrand came at the same time that Figma was introducing Variables. I was so
            excited to get my hands dirty with Variables and Mode swapping for the longest time, and this was the
            perfect case for it! Our first design system, Helix, had a similar token structure to <a
                href="https://m3.material.io/foundations/design-tokens/overview#00974a9c-a3f6-47a3-a99d-018e093fcd7c">Material
                3 by Google</a>.</p>
        <h3>Color Swapping</h3>
        <p>The biggest part of the rebrand was the color. Pfizer now had a new set of defined colors in 10 hues, and had
            begun encouraging all brands to move to those colors as opposed to brands defining their own colors. So I
            was anticipating a mass migration of color which made it paramount.</p>
        <div>
            <p>Based on internal research of the most popular and highest rated brands, most used a primary, secondary,
                and tertiary color. I wanted to expand upon this concept and make the brand selections easier for
                designers and internal clients, so I came up with idea to have the primary, secondary, and tertiary
                colors independent of one another. After creating a file to test the idea, I met with some key members
                of the the larger Customer Experience team and Developer team. They agreed that the independent
                selections of the different color categories is a viable and practical solution that expands the
                broad range of brand color selection. The independent selections accomplishes 2 things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Removes hierarchy from the brands so that one is not more important than the other.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Allows for 1000 color combinations that designers can play with for brand colors to highlight one
                        color over another (and another 1000 if you include dark mode as a wholly separate entity).</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <figure><img src="img/case-studies/mds/mdsColorDiagram.png"
                alt="Flowchart describing color tokens splitting up from references into primary, secondary, and tertiary collections then back together into a unified color scheme.">
        </figure>
        <p>For example, if Brand X’s primary, secondary, and tertiary colors are Red, Purple, and Yellow, the designer
            can swap the color order around to best fit the project and change the whole site's personality with two
            clicks.</p>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p>I had a similar approach when it came to typography. Pfizer’s rebrand had included 5 proprietary font
            families. I created tokens of the font families and attached those to the headings (h1-h6) to allow
            designers to swap families per heading level as needed. This gives designers that much more freedom in
            expression of each project.</p>
        <h3>Layout & Spacing</h3>
        <p>With newfound freedom for designers in finding the most appropriate design language of a project, there still
            needed to be a unifying force that underpins structure across all projects as it all falls under the Pfizer
            umbrella. In looking at the hierarchical grid examples within <em>Making and Breaking the Grid</em> by
            Tymothy Samara, as shown on pages 78 and 79 for IAS Magazine mastheads, I realized we were trying to achieve
            something similar. Different colors, typography, but the same structure and bones across each project.</p>
        <ul class="gap-v gap-h">
            <li>
                <figure><img src="img/case-studies/mds/mdsLayoutMobile.jpg" alt="Mobile screen size">
                    <figcaption>Mobile Grid</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </li>
            <li>
                <figure><img src="img/case-studies/mds/mdsLayoutTablet.jpg" alt="Tablet screen size">
                    <figcaption>Tablet Grid</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </li>
            <li>
                <figure><img src="img/case-studies/mds/mdsLayoutDesktop.jpg" alt="Desktop screen size">
                    <figcaption>Desktop Grid</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I wanted to standardize the breakpoints, components, and patterns’ respective grids, padding, and horizontal
            and vertical spacing. I created different Modes for breakpoints at small, medium, large, and extra large.
            Stepping backwards a bit, the Variable Collection also includes font size for all forms of text from
            headlines to labels to buttons. This way the scale is appropriate for all screens designers are going to
            work within.</p>
        <h3>Border Radius</h3>
        <p>To add some extra personality to Meraki, the team felt it necessary to investigate potential use-cases in
            border radii. We knew early on in the implementation that we'd need both a static collection that cannot
            change and a dynamic collection of radii options that can change in prototypes if necessary.</p>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>In working with our developers, we looked into using Figma's REST API. I learned a little bit of JSON to
            learn how to best categorize the variables into separate sections and categories, as well as bridge a gap in
            communication between the design team and development team.</p>
