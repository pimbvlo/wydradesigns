        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Tokens</h3>
        <p>The internal announcement of a rebrand came at the same time that Figma was introducing Variables. I was so
            excited to get my hands dirty with Variables and Mode swapping for the longest time, and this was the
            perfect case for it!</p>
        <h3>Color Swapping</h3>
        <p>The biggest part of the rebrand was the color. Pfizer now had a new set of defined colors in 10 hues, and had
            begun encouraging all brands to move to those colors as opposed to brands defining their own colors. So we
            were anticipating a mass migration of color which made it paramount.</p>
        <div>
            <p>Based on internal research of the most popular and highest rated brands, most used a primary, secondary,
                and tertiary color. I wanted to expand upon this concept and make the brand selections easier for
                designers and internal clients, so, after discussing with the team, we decided to have the primary,
                secondary, and tertiary colors independent of one another. This accomplishes 2 things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Removes hierarchy from the brands so that one is not more important than the other.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Allows for 1000 color combinations that designers can play with for brand colors to highlight one
                        color over another (and another 1000 if you include dark mode as a wholly separate entity).</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <figure><img src="img/case-studies/mds/mdsColorDiagram.png"
                alt="Flowchart describing color tokens splitting up from references into primary, secondary, and tertiary collections then back together into a unified color scheme.">
        </figure>
        <p>For example, if Brand X’s primary, secondary, and tertiary colors are Red, Purple, and Yellow, the designer
            can
            swap the color order around to best fit the project and change the whole site's personality with two clicks.

            </ul>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p>The team had a similar approach when it came to typography. Pfizer’s rebrand had included 5 proprietary font
            families. We created the font families as tokens and attached those to the headings (h1-h6) to allow
            designers to swap families per heading level as needed. This gives designers that much more freedom in
            expression of each project.</p>
        <h3>Layout & Spacing</h3>
        <p>With newfound freedom in finding the most appropriate design language of a project, there still needed to be
            a unifying force that underpins structure across all projects as it all falls under the Pfizer umbrella. I
            was inspired by one of my favorite reference books, <em>Making and Breaking
                the Grid</em> by Tymothy Samara. In looking at the hierarchical grid examples as shown on pages 78 and
            79 for IAS Magazine mastheads, I realized we were trying to achieve the same thing. Different colors,
            typography, but the same bones.</p>

            <li>
                <figure><img src="img/case-studies/mds/mdsLayoutMobile.jpg"
                        alt="Mobile screen size">

                        alt="Tablet screen size">
                    <figcaption>Tablet Grid</figcaption>
                </figure>

            <li>
                <figure><img src="img/case-studies/mds/mdsLayoutDesktop.jpg"
                        alt="Desktop screen size">
                    <figcaption>Desktop Grid</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We wanted to standardize the breakpoints, components, and patterns’ respective
            grids, padding, and horizontal and vertical spacing. We created different Modes for breakpoints at small,
            medium, large, and extra large. Stepping backwards a bit, the Variable Collection also includes font size
            for all forms of text from headlines to labels to buttons. This way the scale is appropriate for all screens
            designers are going to work within.</p>
        <h3>Border Radius</h3>
        <p>To add some extra personality to Meraki, the team felt it necessary to investigate potential use-cases in
            border radii. We knew early on in the implementation that we'd need both a static collection that cannot
            change and a dynamic collection of radii options that can change in prototypes if necessary.</p>
        <h2>Expansion</h2>
        <p>Utilizing this file and set of foundations, we've been able to expand the breadth of what we offer. On top of
            the core Design System file, we have worked to create three full kits for Data Visualization, AI
            Interactions, Dashboards, with a mobile app kit on the way.</p>
