        <h2>Scope and Constraints</h2>
        <p>Our end users are, of course, the individual brands, but the designers who work to bring the brands’ visions to life and developers who make sure those visions are possible are the main users. As the Lead Design System Designer, I am responsible for developing and implementing the plan to create a Multi-Brand Design System. With an already established and actively used design system, our main constraint was to maintain function of the system as it was still being used by multiple teams. We were limited to using Figma as it is the tool of choice by internal teams and externally by agencies.</p>
