                    <p>This is a poster for a hypothetical guest lecture at University of Pennsylvania's School of Architecture. I chose Oscar Niemeyer and was influenced by the organic curves Oscar Niemeyer used in his architectural designs. His
                        buildings were mainly colored with a primary palette, so I wanted to incorporate that into this poster.</p>
