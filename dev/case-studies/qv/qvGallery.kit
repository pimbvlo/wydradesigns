                    <p>Queen Village was incorporated into the city of Philadelphia in 1854 and is the city’s oldest residential neighborhood. Queen Village was built up by different waves of population change and immigration. It was created
                        originally as a Swedish colony, then over time was inhabited over time it was inhabited by African Americans, Eastern European Jewish immigrants, and Italian immigrants. The village had to adapt to different ways of life. It’s
                        neither gritty nor refined. It’s in a
                        limbo
                        state that seems like people have taken historical buildings and “revamped” them. I wanted to design something that seemed just as planned as it was randomized.</p>
