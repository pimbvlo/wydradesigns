            <p>There’s a lot of flourishes and decorative elements on the facades of buildings. Since it is in Philly, there’s a lot of interesting murals everywhere. The only natural phenomena were the trees planted mathematically along the
                sidewalk. I wanted to add more green to the area, so that is the one singular color amongst the grey color palette I created. Due to the waves of industrial changes the area had endured, I wanted to use an industrial typeface, Archer
                Pro, as well as the graphics and symbols.</p>
