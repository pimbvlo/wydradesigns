            <p class="section-padding">The name comes from the final step of cheese-making: salting the cheese and letting it age. I wanted the color palette to have an even softness to it to mimic soft cheeses. The yellow was chosen from brie, and
                the blue from blue cheese. The opening spread of the main story was created through original photography and hours and hours of photo manipulation to extend the length of the wooden cutting board and making the food on the board look
                practically perfect. The text spread concept was created through a mask to mimic the other side of the cheese wheel. The table of contents’ spread was designed to mimic the photo on the opposite page’s boards and boards of cheese.</p>
