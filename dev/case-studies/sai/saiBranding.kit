            reps would need to go through multiple paragraphs of research. For this reason, all body copy uses a larger

            needs to look up some information in front of the HCP, they aren’t suddenly disoriented with a bright
            screen. Since iOS is placing a heavier requirement on Liquid Glass, I also introduced some Liquid Glass
            components, such as the Navigation.</p>
