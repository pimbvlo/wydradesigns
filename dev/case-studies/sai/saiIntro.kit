        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I was given the proposal to create a tool to assist pharmaceutical representatives and customer facing
            colleagues with their daily schedules and meetings with Healthcare Professionals (HCPs). Pfizer
            representatives are always on the go from meeting to meeting informing HCPs of their company's products and
            what they do. Because representatives spend a majority of their time in between meetings and sitting in
            office waiting rooms, they need a portable assistant to help them plan their day.</p>
        <p><em>How might we keep Pharmaceutical Representatives on schedule and at the top of their game?</em></p>
