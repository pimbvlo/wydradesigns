        <h2>Outcomes and Lessons</h2>
        <p>Because of the existing app, our suggestion of creating a new separate app was met with pushback because it
            required a new set of security features. Due to Pfizer reprioritizing various initiatives, this project was
            never fully realized, so no KPIs could be accurately measured out in the field.</p>
        <p>My favorite part of Scout was how different the experience is as compared to apps I have used and/or worked
            on. The hybridization between traditional app components like the navigation, tables, and menu and the chat
            integration made Scout such a unique challenge and I think it's an interesting direction to which the
            industry could move. </p>
