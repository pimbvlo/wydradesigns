        <h2>Process</h2>
        <div>
            <p>I co-hosted a workshop to ideate on potential concepts based on the more concrete requirements I had
                received. We collectively worked on user flows of pre-meeting, mid-meeting, and post-meeting tasks, of
                which I drew pencil sketches of some screen ideas. In the middle of sketching, I had an “aha!” moment.
                I remembered my mother’s PalmPilot growing up, which had almost all the same product requirements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>A calendar</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A daily planner</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>An address book</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A GPS &#40;which later palm devices included&#41;</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The only additional requirement we had to focus on was to center it around answering HCP-related
                questions as all projects require a level of complexity to tailor it to its unique problem solving.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Migration Process</h3>
        <p>Due to representatives already using an existing tool, the workshop members worked together to create the
            beginnings of a plan to slowly migrate more reps with each passing year.</p>

        <h3>User Flow</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Each daily routine a representative has can be broken down into three steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Pre-Meeting</b></p>
                    <p>Everything from taking a look at their schedule, reading an analysis of prescribers, to preparing
                        for a meeting.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Meeting</b></p>
                    <p>The sit-down discussion with the Healthcare Professional.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Post-Meeting</b></p>
                    <p>Reps need to record the discussion and take action &#40;Order samples, write followup email, etc.&#41;</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
