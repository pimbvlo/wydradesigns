        <h2>Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
        <p>The idea behind Scout is part traditional app components and part chat. I designed the homepage to have
            everything a rep needs to see at a glance, like how their Call Plan is going, or any changes may have
            happened since they last opened the app. Beneath the stats, Scout will suggest topics based on time of day,
            brands the rep is managing.</p>

        <p>The menu contains user-pinned topics to start a new pre-populated chat, an option to create a new pinned
            topic, view chat history from the last 14 days, and a clear chat history button.</p>

        <p>I created “Meeting Mode” for a Rep to get a quick glance at the Healthcare Professional's details pertaining
            to the brands they may ask about, as well as sample orders they may ask about. I also included an elapsed
            time for the Representative to discretely see because both Reps and HCPs have very rigid schedules they need
            to adhere to.</p>

        <p>For the post-meeting, Representatives need to document how the meeting went, if there are any follow-ups such
            as ordering samples or making sure deliveries are on time, as well as any other notes needed about the
            relationship. This mockup is for the Reps option to fill the form out on their own and upload it to Scout
            manually through either their files app, or take a photo of the printed and filled out form and upload it
            that way. There is another option for users to record the form together with the app asking the questions
            from the form and user entering each input in a Q&A format.</p>

        <p>This HCP Profile screen is similar to the view in Meeting Mode except it contains more details about the
            HCP's office location, as well as a button to open the map and set up directions to the office.</p>
