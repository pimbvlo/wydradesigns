        <h2>Scope and Constraints</h2>
        <p>Representatives' days are hectic and they constantly find themselves in varying situations, so the tool needs
            to be as adaptable as the representatives themselves. The current tool they use has information buried
            within different sections of a one-stop-shop application on an iPad, so it takes upwards of 5 minutes for
            all the data to load for each request. Pharma reps are meant to be experts on the brands they represent, and
            need to know the conditions their products treat, so taking 5 minutes of waiting just to begin researching
            information to answer a question is a source of frustration.</p>
