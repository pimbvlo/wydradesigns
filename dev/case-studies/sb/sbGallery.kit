                    <p>While abroad, my project was to create a poster based on the history, feel, and overall aesthetic of a neighborhood in London. From the list of locations, I picked Southwark & Bermondsey. I felt that the juxtaposition of
                        historical buildings and landmarks to modern buildings was an interesting dichotomy. Based on that, I designed a symmetrical poster that could work regardless of vertical orientation, emphasizing the contrast between modern
                        and historical.</p>
