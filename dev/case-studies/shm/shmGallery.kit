                    <p>I rebranded Philadelphiaâ€™s Science History Institute into the Science History Museum. Since museum admission is free and open to the public, I decided the best way to reach a wide audience around Philadelphia was through public
                        transit. It's such a highly visible way to reach the masses throughout the city, and it felt like a perfect match for the Museum.</p>
