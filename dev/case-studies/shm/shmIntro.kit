            <p>I rebranded Philadelphiaâ€™s Science History Institute into the Science History Museum. Since museum admission is free and open to the public, I decided the best way to reach a wide audience around Philadelphia was through public
                transit. It's such a highly visible way to reach the masses throughout the city. It felt like a perfect match for the Museum.</p>
