            <p>I wanted the museum to have a brand that was vastly different than other museum in the area. I was inspired by their rich archive of science related imagery and graphics, as well as duotone imagery with layered text. Their archives
                include diagrams, advertisements, photographs, and portraits dating all the way back to the 1440's. Looking through their archive, I realized how underutilized it was throughout the museum and their brochures and magazines. The use of
                duotone imagery and text weaving in and out of the photographs was how they would be set apart, as well as where they were advertising.</p>
