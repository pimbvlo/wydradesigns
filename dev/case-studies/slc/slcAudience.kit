        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>My audience is households who regularly throw out food (primarily produce) that has gone bad, primarily
            because they forgot that they had it but would have otherwise used it. I created a screener survey to search
            for participants who are over 20 years old, go grocery shopping regularly (regardless if it’s online or
            in-store), and sometimes accidentally forget a fruit or vegetable from time to time. I sent it through
            various channels such as Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook and had 17 responses, of which I conducted 4
            interviews + 1 interview with a Composting SME.</p>

        <p>Meet Corrina Brennan. She wants to use up her produce before it goes to waste, and if it does go to waste,
            she wants to give it to a composter so it’s less harmful to the environment. She’s very comfortable with
            technology as she’s practically terminally online anyway.</p>

        <p>Meet Oliver MacDonald. He needs organic compost and wants to get rid of his Grade 2 produce that grocery
            stores won’t buy off of him and that he feels bad getting rid of. He mainly uses technology surrounding
            agriculture as he gets frustrated with any other digital tools/products.</p>
