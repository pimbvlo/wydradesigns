        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The primary reason I created Second Life Composting is due to households being the #1 producer of food waste
            in the US. Food waste is a multifaceted issue from production, to consumption, to waste. About 30–40% of the
            food supply in the US is just not consumed. (<a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs"
                target="_blank">USDA</a>) On average, that’s about 219 pounds of food per
            person per year. This impacts waste management as well. Around 40
            million tons of food waste go right into
            landfills. (<a

        </p>
        <p><em>So what if we were able to divert our waste from landfills and support our communities, local farms, and
                community gardens by composting?</em></p>
