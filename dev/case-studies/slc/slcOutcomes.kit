        <h2>Outcomes and Lessons</h2>
        <p>The next primary step is to go through user testing with multiple participants for the Consumers’ side. I
            would also like to build out the Farmers’ side of the platform for where they can order compost and/or
            animal bedding and list what’s available for tickets.</p>
        <h3>Future Features</h3>
        <p>Assuming all goes well with the testing and subsequent iterations, here are some features I think should be
            added to Second Life:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Ability to take a photo of their receipt and add the food to a digital “fridge” to let you know when
                    your food is about to turn</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>With the digital “fridge”, Second Life will be able to recommend recipes based on what you have (and
                    tell you what you’d need to buy)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ability to connect with local food pantries/ community fridges/ other local organizations to see what
                    they’re in need of and how you can help them</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
