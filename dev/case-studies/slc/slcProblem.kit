        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Organic landfill waste produces Methane, a greenhouse gas, via anaerobic decomposition. It’s a slow process
            to break down the organic material. Methane is 28–36 times more effective at trapping heat than Carbon
            Dioxide. Landfills can also contain chemicals and low-grade radiation. (<a

        <p>On the other hand, composting is generally done via aerobic decomposition, meaning it has access to
            free-flowing Oxygen to speed up the process. Compost reduces the need for chemical fertilizer and can yield
            a higher amount of crops. On top of that, it also aids in water retention and can help with reforestation
            and restoration of land. (<a

        <p>With that discovery, I came up with my topic: <strong>How might we elevate the food waste that households
                produce to give them a greater purpose other than “waste”?</strong></p>
