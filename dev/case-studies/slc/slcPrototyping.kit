        <h2>Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
        <p>Important note: I started sketching in mobile with the intent it would be built out on desktop as 3/5 of my
            participants said they’d most likely be on their computers when (1) looking up recipes, and (2) when they’d
            most likely schedule a pick up for compost.</p>
        <img src="img/case-studies/slc/slcSketch1.jpg" alt="Original sketches for Second Life Composting">
        <p>Initially, I also had an idea to create a digital fridge to accompany the app to give recipes based on
            receipt scans the user logged. But that idea sadly had to be abandoned for the sake of time. It is added and
            more fleshed out in the Next Steps section below.</p>

        <p>Here is a more built-out lo-fi mobile wireframe set of Second Life Composting. The first is the initial
            concept for a dashboard, which eventually became the Compost page of the web app. It also includes the flow
            for how a user would order a pickup for their compost bag. The second image was my first draft of a recipes
            list, in the web app it changed to be friendlier and less
            compact by using cards. The final image is the profile page that includes posts the user has written, saved
            posts, and their fridge
            (which evolved into the Tickets section)</p>
        <h3>High Fidelity Designs</h3>
        <img src="img/case-studies/slc/slcFlow1.jpg" alt="Onboarding flow">
        <p>Introducing the user to Second Life and allowing them to pre-select composters in their area that they might
            be interested in.</p>
        <img src="img/case-studies/slc/slcFlow2.jpg" alt="Compost page, management, and pickup flow">
        <p>The Compost page functions as the home page where the user can see how the composts are doing as well as
            their next pick-up’s status. This screen also explains what can and cannot be composted and why. It also
            leads our users to a composter management screen where they can follow/unfollow composters and check the
            statistics on the composters in the area.</p>
        <p>The Schedule Pick Up form allows users to pick a time, date, back size, and drop-off location for their
            compost bags. The more they donate, the more tickets they can earn for their next farmers' market.</p>
        <img src="img/case-studies/slc/slcFlow3.jpg" alt="Recipes flow">
        <p>In order to “save” their food. Users can look up user-generated recipes so they can give their produce and
            other ingredients a… Second Life!</p>
        <img src="img/case-studies/slc/slcFlow4.jpg" alt="Profile flow">
        <p>Their profile is where they can look at their posts, previously saved recipes, and farmers' market tickets.

        <h3>Insight & Revisions</h3>
        <p>EMI found that a lot of people do want to compost and waste less food, but are fairly unsure of how to go
            about doing it. My personal opinion is that there needs to be a whole reframing of people’s mindsets about
            what’s truly considered “waste”.</p>
        <p>I also found that a lot of farmers donate their unsold produce to pantries, or are bought by organizations
            that create food boxes for low-income individuals/households.</p>
        <p>I ended up starting with a different project, so switching gears around Week 2/3 created hurdles. Given more
            time, I would like to have conducted more initial interviews with Consumers, as they are the #1 producers of
            food waste. I’d also like to have been able to interview food pantries to ask about their processes.</p>
        <p>I also underestimated how long certain tasks would take, so moving forward I’ll know to add extra time to
            certain activities.</p>
