        <h2>Roles and Responsi&shy;bi&shy;li&shy;ties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Jilene Jackson</strong> — Product Owner / UX Designer</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Shawn Wydra</strong> — UX Designer / Researcher / Accessibility Specialist</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Octavia Ashton</strong> — UX Designer / Researcher / Content Strategist</p>
            </li>
            <li>

        <p>As a designer and accessibility specialist, I had the privilege of vocally advocating for a higher standard
            of design for Target™ employees in our MVP Target™ Drive Up prototype. Throughout the project, I urged
            everyone to think more critically about the users, who they were, and what they&#39;d need to see at-a-glance on
            this application.</p>
        <p>Key decisions I made as a UX/UI Designer were:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Scoured the Target™ website for all typefaces, colors, iconography, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After user feedback from usability tests and several in-group debates, redid the key/legend for the
                    cubbies so that employees are more quickly and better informed about cubby state</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After learning that Target™&#39;s myDevices are android based, I advocated for Material Design System to
                    be a base for our design system</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Added the shopper&#39;s profile on the top of most screens so that employees are aware of who they&#39;re
                    shopping for</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Key decisions I made as an Accessibility Advocate were:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Added patterns to cubbies to make it color-blind friendly</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add uniform spacing rules to create more universality from section to section</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
