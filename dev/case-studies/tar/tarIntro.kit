        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>As a team, we worked collaboratively to help improve the experience for the Target™ Team Members. In a time of
            Social Distancing, Guest Experience is key and in high demand; for Target™ Team Members, being
            able to complete an order for a Guest Pick-Up is crucial, especially when Target™ receives 200-400 Drive Up
            Orders per day.</p>
        <p>By improving the quality of Target™&#39;s Curbside Pick-up and implementing a socially distant Cubby System
            for guests — this not only helps Target™ Team Members feel safe but also improves the quality of customer
            service for Team Members while continuing to give back to the community.</p>
