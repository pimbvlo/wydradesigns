        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>As a team, we worked collaboratively to help improve the experience for the Target™ Team Members. In a time of
            Social Distancing, Guest Experience is key and in high demand; for Target™ Team Members, being
            able to complete an order for a Guest Pick-Up is crucial, especially when Target™ receives 200-400 Drive Up
            Orders per day.</p>
        <p>By improving the quality of Target™&#39;s Curbside Pick-up and implementing a socially distant Cubby System
            for guests — this not only helps Target™ Team Members feel safe but also improves the quality of customer
            service for Team Members while continuing to give back to the community.</p>

        <h3>Design Concept</h3>
        <p>During our in-class breakout session, we discussed our collective desire to work on designing a prototype for
            an app that is different from the class project prompt of an Expedia competitor or another hotel booking
            company. As a team, we liked the example of the class prompt&#39;s competitor edge — “COVID related”. With the
            current state of the global pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions, our team thought it would great to
            support the lives of millions of people with a digital product that solves an everyday problem; a
            contactless shopping experience. We started brainstorming potential companies like food delivery services.
            However, we decided to go in a different direction since many of our cohort&#39;s previous in-class assignments
            revolved around companies like Door Dash and Uber Eats.</p>
        <p>After sharing personal experiences with our own contactless shopping experiences, we decided to move forward
            with a contactless shopping experience theme. We were able to narrow down our ideal company from food
            delivery to grocery delivery to a company that would combine both. We started looking at larger retailers
            that can provide curbside pick up for daily household essentials as well. We decided as a team that Target™
            what be a great company to work on to study and improve their curbside shopping experience.</p>
