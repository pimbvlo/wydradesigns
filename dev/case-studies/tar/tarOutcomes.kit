        <h2>Outcomes and Lessons</h2>
        <p>After our first round of Usability Testing for the Target Prototype, we received feedback by participants and
            generated iterations to the design system. Here are some beneficial steps moving forward:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Kick-off with a second round of Usability Testing; in order to work out any user discrepancies during
                    the first round. The end goal is to test out the iteration of our prototype.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>As a team, adding and redefining our goals; doing another accessibility check and iteration of the
                    prototype after a second round.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Usability Testing round. Presenting our application modifications to Target Executives in the hopes
                    that it will be used by Target Team Members in real-time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We also recommend conversing with a development team to check the feasibility of engineering and
                    coding our MVP prototype system.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
