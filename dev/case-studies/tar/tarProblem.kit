        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>As the world comes to a pause and masks are becoming the new norm, curbside pickup has revolutionized the way
            society does retail and grocery shopping.</p>
        <p>Knowing this, Team IV&#39;s goal for the design is to improve the quality and safety of their Target™ Team
            Members. As a Target™ Team Member, it can be difficult to fulfill a Curbside Pick-up Order when you&#39;re
            not
            notified of the Guest&#39;s order status. As a collective, we&#39;ve come up with the Target™ Tracker to
            simplify and
            ease the process of fulfilling orders as employees deal with large volumes of orders throughout the day.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Target™ Tracker, we&#39;ve added a Cubby Feature to separate Guests&#39; orders along with
            a
            Curbside Preference Feature for Guests to select their contactless delivery method to their vehicle to
            social distance as much as possible during this unconventional time.</p>
        <h3>How Might We Question</h3>
        <p>Additionally, we&#39;ve come up with the How Might We Question which states, <strong>How might we enhance the
                ease of fulfilling Drive-Up (curbside pick up) orders for Target™ employees like Target™ Travis?</strong>
