        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>During our in-class breakout session, we discussed our collective desire to work on designing a prototype for
            an app that is different from the class project prompt of an Expedia competitor or another hotel booking
            company. As a team, we liked the example of the class prompt&#39;s competitor edge — “COVID related”. With
            the
            current state of the global pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions, our team thought it would great to
            support the lives of millions of people with a digital product that solves an everyday problem; a
            contactless shopping experience. We started brainstorming potential companies like food delivery services.
            However, we decided to go in a different direction since many of our cohort&#39;s previous in-class
            assignments
            revolved around companies like Door Dash and Uber Eats.</p>
        <p>After sharing personal experiences with our own contactless shopping experiences, we decided to move forward
            with a contactless shopping experience theme. We were able to narrow down our ideal company from food
            delivery to grocery delivery to a company that would combine both. We started looking at larger retailers
            that can provide curbside pick up for daily household essentials as well. We decided as a team that Target™
            what be a great company to work on to study and improve their curbside shopping experience.</p>
        <h3>Design Concept</h3>
        <p>As the world comes to a pause and masks are becoming the new norm, curbside pickup has revolutionized the way
            society does retail and grocery shopping.</p>
        <p>Knowing this, Team IV&#39;s goal for the design is to improve the quality and safety of their Target™ Team
            Members. As a Target™ Team Member, it can be difficult to fulfill a Curbside Pick-up Order when you&#39;re
            not
            notified of the Guest&#39;s order status. As a collective, we&#39;ve come up with the Target™ Tracker to
            simplify and
            ease the process of fulfilling orders as employees deal with large volumes of orders throughout the day.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Target™ Tracker, we&#39;ve added a Cubby Feature to separate Guests&#39; orders along with
            a
            Curbside Preference Feature for Guests to select their contactless delivery method to their vehicle to
            social distance as much as possible during this unconventional time.</p>
        <h3>How Might We Question</h3>
        <p>Additionally, we&#39;ve come up with the How Might We Question which states, <strong>How might we enhance the
                ease of fulfilling Drive-Up (curbside pick up) orders for Target™ employees like Target™
                Travis?</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>What does success look like? Identify the key points that the user will use on your product as their
            achievement. Highlight goals your designs should meet at the end of the project.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Goal 1:</strong> Understand the behaviors and needs of Target™ employees who fulfill
                    curbside pick-up orders.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Goal 2:</strong> Solve the problem of a labor-intensive workflow for employees when
                    fulfilling curbside pick-up orders in the time of COVID.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Goal 3:</strong> Solve needs for employees that need to be updated in real-time utilizing the
                    Target™
                    Tracker.</p>
