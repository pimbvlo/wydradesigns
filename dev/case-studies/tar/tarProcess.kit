        <h3>Lean Canvas</h3>
        <img src="img/case-studies/tar/LeanCanvas.jpg" alt="A chart detailing the Problem and Solution Team IV is working through">
        <p><strong>Business Problem:</strong> Target employees are not able to track in real-time what phase a
            shopper&#39;s
            order is in when fulfilling a curbside pickup order.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Designing the Target™ Tracker for Target™ employees to track their fulfillment of
            Target™&#39;s Drive Up orders — modeled after the Domino™&#39;s Pizza Tracker.</p>
        <p><strong>Unique Value Proposition:</strong> Team IV wanted to stick with a proposition that rang true to
            Target™'s existing tagline: "Expect More. Pay Less." EXPECT MORE of the same great shopping experience
            inside the TARGET™ app with curbside pick up that&#39;s easy and CONTACT LESS with the ability to TRACK
            ITEMS no
            matter where you are in the pick-up process using the Target Tracker.</p>
        <h3>Affinity Map</h3>
        <p>These six patterns were discovered through an affinity mapping exercise using digital whiteboard MIRO to
            synthesize data gleaned from user interviews.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brands With Best Contactless Shopping Experience</li>
            <li>User&#39;s Curbside Goals</li>
            <li>Curbside Likes</li>
            <li>Curbside Frustrations</li>
            <li>User&#39;s Shopping/Retail Experience During Quarantine</li>
            <li>User&#39;s Wishlist of Curbside Features</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Synthesized data from the affinity map formed our MVP features validating Target Travis workflow.</p>
