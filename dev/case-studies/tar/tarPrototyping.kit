        <h2>Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
        <p>As a team, our brainstorming methods were crazy 8 and user flow diagrams. Our key goals for the design was to
            make it user-friendly at first glance, validating the employee&#39;s needs through gratification while
            keeping
            the brand loyaty of Target&#39;s signature color scheme.</p>
        <p>Below showcases our process sketches of low-fidelity wireframes:</p>
        <div class="gap-v gap-h gallery-1-col">
            <ul class="gap-v gap-h gallery-2-col">
                <li>
                    <img src="img/case-studies/tar/TargetSketch2.jpg" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src="img/case-studies/tar/TargetSketch1.jpg" alt="">
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The prototype was designed within the Target employee app and website. The goal of the design was to maintain
            the brand loyalty by preserving Target&#39;s orginal color scheme, iconography, and typography referenced by
            the
            Target website.</p>
        <p>The Target team uses myDevices through Android&#39;s operating platform. As a team, we maintained
            Target&#39;s
            Material Design elements while implimenting additionals to the design system such as the social distant
            curbside and cubby feature. Once the prototype was discussed and refined, the team presented the design
            system to a series of users for additional feedback.</p>
