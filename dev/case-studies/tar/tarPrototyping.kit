        <h2>Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
        <p>As a team, our brainstorming methods were crazy 8 and user flow diagrams. Our key goals for the design was to
            make it user-friendly at first glance, validating the employee&#39;s needs through gratification while
            keeping
            the brand loyaty of Target&#39;s signature color scheme.</p>
        <p>Below showcases our process sketches of low-fidelity wireframes:</p>
        <div class="gap-v gap-h gallery-1-col">
            <ul class="gap-v gap-h gallery-2-col">

                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The prototype was designed within the Target employee app and website. The goal of the design was to maintain
            the brand loyalty by preserving Target&#39;s orginal color scheme, iconography, and typography referenced by
            the
            Target website.</p>
        <p>The Target team uses myDevices through Android&#39;s operating platform. As a team, we maintained
            Target&#39;s
            Material Design elements while implimenting additionals to the design system such as the social distant
            curbside and cubby feature. Once the prototype was discussed and refined, the team presented the design
            system to a series of users for additional feedback.</p>

        <h3>High Fidelity Designs</h3>
        <p>Utilizing our style guide and the Material Design System was our team designed sections of the Target Travis
            workflow to create High-Fidelity wireframes that were based on scenes from the team’s Crazy 8’s sketches of
            Target Travis’s curbside fulfillment workflow. The goal of the high-fidelity wireframes is to iterate on
            the low-fidelity wireflows with more detailed features like color, components unique to our design,
            transofrmation of the wireframes into a clickable prototype. The Target Tracker feature also received the
            high fidelity treatment and further tests the idea of a user’s ability to track curbside orders in real time
            with live clickable actions. The prototype accomplishes a workflow that is less labor-intensive and helps
            Target Travis fill curbside orders more efficiently.</p>
        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>During testing, we came across a handful of glitches that needed to be patched and reworked. The most notable
            changes that needed to be made were that the Tracker needed to be moved elsewhere from being pinned on the
            top of the screen which cause the Tracker to be unobtrusive to users. As well as, recreating and reworking
            the cubby’s legend/key so that it’s more comprehensive to the users. Now that we’ve completed our newest
            iteration, we’d like to re-test the prototype amongst a more focused group, primarily consisting of
            employees who would be theoretically using this application.</p>
        <h3>Insight & Revisions</h3>
        <p>This section highlights consolidated insights and revisions as a team and the feedback that was collected
            through a series of usability tests from our participants.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Some Users Expressed “Screens Were Too Long”</strong></p>
                <p>Redesigned certain screens by shortening the length and solving the problem of users not scrolling to
                    reveal key information relevant to Guest Tina’s order.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Cut Down ‘Congratulations’ Screens</strong></p>
                <p>Reducing the number of instant gratification screens in order to simplify our flow and cut down
                    real-time for the users.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>The Beginning Flow Was Redundant</strong></p>
                <p>We simplified the sign in flow to offer two user experiences; one with a full login experience and
                    one with a simplified experience that allows a user to begin orders after being prompted from a
                    notification.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Reselected Cubby Colors</strong></p>
                <p>Keeping in mind the stoplight method, We changed our colors so users wouldn’t associate certain
                    colors with their own subconscious thinking. We added differentiators on the cubbies and key
                    patterns to accommodate those whom might have disabilities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Redesigning the Target Tracker</strong></p>
                <p>Throughout our Usability Testing, users were missing the Target Tracker up at the top of the flow;
                    so, we’ve moved it down and added animation to each target tracker as it changes phases to call the
                    user’s attention.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Implemented Animations to the Target Tracker</strong></p>
                <p>As a team, when faced with users omission of the Target Tracker in its original state, we’ve designed
                    animations as a focal point to the user; this brought up a good point of Accessibility for those
                    with sensitivity to blinking lights that might potentially cause seizures in the workplace.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
