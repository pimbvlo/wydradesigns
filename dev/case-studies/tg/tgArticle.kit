        <p>Since its founding in 2012, Tinder has evolved dating apps into a game based on one&#39;s superficial
            judgment.
            Nine years later, it&#39;s one of the world&#39;s most popular dating apps with an estimated 66 million
            monthly
            active users (MAU). (Statista) 50% of those MAU are members of Gen Z, ages 18 to 25. (“Tinder Newsroom —
            About Tinder”) Tinder broke the online dating mold and strayed away from the traditional way dating sites
            functioned. “Online dating sites… frequently offer users more than just a handful of profiles for
            side-by-side comparison. Indeed, they often present users with nearly simultaneous access to (the profiles
            of) many potential partners, sometimes thousands of them, who vary in complex ways across a wide range of
            characteristics.” (Finkel et al.) The way Tinder functions is seemingly simpler than traditional dating
            sites. The user makes a profile with their photo, adds a blurb about themselves, sets the setting for who
            they want to potentially meet, and then they&#39;re ready to start. They swipe right on someone to Like them
            and
            swipe left to Pass. If someone they “swiped right” on Likes them back, then it&#39;s considered a Match, and
            then the two can start chatting. This “double opt-in” method is primarily how Tinder broke away from
            traditional sites. (Tinder) The way Tinder shows profiles to the users is that it calculates a user&#39;s
            Elo
            score weighed against a user&#39;s (who Likes them) own Elo score. “The more right swipes that person had,
            the
            more their right swipe on you meant for your score.” (Tiffany) Tinder then shows the user other profiles
            that have similar scores. This is the old way Tinder works, but the new algorithm works in a very similar
            way, just without an official ranking associated with each users&#39; profile. (Tiffany)</p>
        <h2>How Tinder Works</h2>
        <h3>Gamification</h3>
        <p>The new game-like features, such as the swiping, the Boosts, Rewinds, and Super Likes and the anticipation of
            a Match, are what gamified the dating app beyond just looking at someone else&#39;s profile. This is a
            process
            known as Gamification, “the process of adding games or gamelike elements to something to encourage
            participation.” (“Gamification”) It&#39;s a popular tactic in most industries to make activities fun and to
            encourage people to get involved. It&#39;s not a new concept, but it has exploded over the last several
            years.
        </p>
        <p>Tinder is, generally speaking, a free app. But, it also has three tiers of monthly or annual plans aside from
            its basic free plan, each having its unique perks, for those who want a little extra help. The basic paid
            plan is Tinder Plus, then Tinder Gold, where you can see who Liked you before you even start swiping, and,
            their most expensive plan, Tinder Platinum, which you can message someone before even Matching with them.
            (Tinder) As of Q3 of 2020, 10% of the 66 million MAU are paid subscribers, regardless of plan. (Statista)
            Non-paying users have a limit of 50 Likes every 12 hours, and every paid tier has an unlimited amount of
            Likes. On top of that, free users are bombarded with “reminders&#39;&#39; that they can pay for a plan to
            remove the
            cap on Likes, as well as sporadic interruptions where users can purchase Boosts/Super Boosts and Super
            Likes. Boosts/Super Boosts are a way to get around Tinder&#39;s Elo-like algorithm to put oneself “ahead of
            the
            line”, for a limited amount of time. Boosts promise 10 times more profile views, and Super Boosts promise up
            to 100 times more profiles. It is worth noting that at the time of writing this, Super Boosts aren&#39;t
            available everywhere right now, it&#39;s only available in select areas. (Tinder) In January 2021 alone,
            Tinder
            made 64.62 million USD. (Statista)</p>
        <h3>Psychology</h3>
        <p>Jeff Johnson, author of Designing with the Mind in Mind, has defined the Sunk Cost Fallacy as a “tendency to
            stick with a decision and even put more resources into a losing cause.” (Johnson 208) People feel that the
            more they put into something, they should be getting back an equal or higher return on their investment.
            They don&#39;t want to feel that their time was, effectively, wasted. Such as when they are purchasing plans
            or
            individual Boosts or Super Likes. The IKEA Effect plays a similar role to the Sunk Cost Fallacy within the
            realm of dating and dating apps. Johnson describes the IKEA Effect as valuing things more after an effort is
            put into them. (Johnson 208) When users put in more money and time into swiping, or even just talking to
            those they Matched with, they internally place more value on the app or on the individual. The way that the
            payment is structured on Tinder, through these microtransactions, is the same structure that mobile games
            use. Microtransactions are:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>Commonly refers to a business model… where users can purchase virtual goods via micropayments…
                    Microtransactions (i.e., premium content) may include downloadable content such as story extensions
                    (so
                    called 'DLCs'), additional play time, levels, new maps, virtual currency, weapons, armor,
                    characters, or
                    cosmetic items to customize the player&#39;s character or items. The player pays… directly with real
                    world
                    currency or with some form of fantasy virtual currency (e.g., gold). (Schwiddessen and Karius
                    18)</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Keller Gordon explains that “Certain microtransactions fall somewhere in between cosmetic enhancements and
            pay-to-win… While these in-game purchases can&#39;t give you an edge against an opponent, they affect where
            you fall in the rankings.” (Gordon) The virtual goods that these Tinder Plus/Gold/Platinum users are paying
            for
            are the chance to put their faces in front of people for the potential chance to Match with them by using
            Super Likes and Boosts and by removing the 50 Likes cap. But, if people aren&#39;t receiving those matches,
            the Sunk Cost Fallacy states that they&#39;re highly likely to pay for more “Tinder DLC.” And the more they
            pay,
            the more likely they are to stay on the metaphorical “sinking ship”.</p>
        <p>If we consider the brain chemistry that plays into this, we can see how the mix of the Sunk Cost Fallacy and
            Tinder ends up potentially creating an addiction. In Dr. Robert Sapolsky&#39;s talk, he speaks about the
            dopamine levels between the Signal, Work, and Reward. Most people would expect that the highest point of
            dopamine would be once the subject gets the reward, but, the converse was true as the study went on. The
            highest levels of dopamine were recorded between the Signal and Work, showing that the reward was
            effectively meaningless and that it&#39;s all about the anticipation of the reward. Meaning, that people
            keep
            chasing after the anticipation of the reward (especially when that reward is unpredictable), and once
            obtained, they just want that anticipation once more. (Sapolsky) (Henderson, and Schrader) This is easily
            viewed within Tinder and the structure of the app. The Signal is the user sending out Likes/Passes for the
            potential to get Match, which is the reward. The Work is the other users doing the same thing for other
            people. Effectively, when the user is swiping left or right, they are the Signal for themselves, and the
            Work for others, both of whom are working to be each others&#39; Match/Reward. So, if people keep searching
            for
            that anticipation, they&#39;re even more inclined to purchase more Boosts, Super Likes, or even different
            paid
            tiers.</p>
        <p>The Sunk Cost Fallacy also applies to what happens even after people Match, when they are in a relationship.
            People tend to stay in relationships for a little while after they should, specifically due to the Sunk Cost
            Fallacy. Due to the IKEA Effect, they also place a higher value on the relationship because of the time and
            effort that they have put into it. They feel that because of that, it&#39;s worth sticking it out a little
            longer, even if they&#39;re unhappy. (Gander) Based on several conflicting sources, the average person is a
            part
            3 to 12 different relationships before marriage. According to Tinder, the app averages 1.5 million dates per
            week and has had 60+ billion total Matches. (“Tinder Newsroom — About Tinder”) There is no definite number,
            but it&#39;s easy to conclude that not every first date leads to relationships. There will always be awkward
            first dates, and one-night stands, so those users will most likely stay on Tinder. But the ones that lead to
            relationships will statistically lead some users back to Tinder after a breakup. So the Sunk Cost Fallacy
            keeps users on Tinder, and those that end up in relationships will most likely bring them back to Tinder or
            another dating app/site (just to even try a different one).</p>
        <h3>Design Implications</h3>
        <p>The more user-friendly design implications of this research are to intentionally “slow down” the app.
            It&#39;s a
            common trend on Tinder and other dating apps for people to start swiping out of boredom, so putting
            metaphorical speed bumps in their way will break up the habituation, or the “repeated exposure to the same
            perceptions [that] dulls our perceptual system&#39;s sensitivity to them.” (Johnson 4) If there is a way to
            count swipes per second, then after a certain amount of swipes there should be a modal pop-up telling the
            user to “slow down and smell the roses” by looking at the photos of those they&#39;re swiping on or to look
            at
            their photos.</p>
        <p>Because Tinder&#39;s parent company is Match Group, it can potentially learn from other intellectual property
            owned by the same parent company. Hinge is another popular dating app. It self proclaims to be “designed to
            be deleted,” meaning it understands that it&#39;s only supposed to be temporary in that it encourages its
            users
            to make real connections with their matches. Its draw is the fact that it forces the user to pick something
            from the person&#39;s profile that they like or can talk about, and send the potential match a message about
            said topic. (“What Is Hinge?”) It breaks up the habituation by forcing the user to make an intentional
            decision on each profile they come across.</p>
        <p>On the business side of the app, Mr. Gary Swidler, the chief financial officer (CFO), of Match Group said,
            “You get a huge advantage by getting a lot of free users.” He explained that the more people that sign up
            for Tinder, the more people who will potentially pay for the “Tinder DLC” later down the line. (Bromwich)
            Each new user is offered a 3-day free trial to Tinder Gold, but extending that timing to a week could lead
            to more subscriptions further down the road since the users would have had more time to get used to those
            perks, then realize the limitations of the free version of the app.</p>
        <p>Since Tinder is one of the leading dating apps worldwide and has already revolutionized how dating apps work,
            it can also re-revolutionize how relationships can stay together. It&#39;s not out of the realm of
            possibility
            that Tinder could also create a section of the app for couples or even a companion app for those who are
            already in relationships. Adding in a way for couples to meet, or to create randomized date night
            suggestions that would encourage couples to stay together, and adds a potential new source of subscriptions
            and revenue for Tinder.</p>
        <p>Tinder broke the mold by gamifying dating apps. They created the concept of swiping on people&#39;s profiles
            in
            order to have the double opt-in to form Matches. They also added different tiers of perks for users to
            purchase. Those microtransactions, combined with the psychology behind the Sunk Cost Fallacy and the
            dopamine rush in the anticipation of Matches, means that Tinder has made the perfect app to keep users on
            their platform, for better or worse.</p>
