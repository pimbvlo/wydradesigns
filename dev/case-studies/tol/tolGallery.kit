                    <p>I wanted to do an independent study regarding the history of typography in London, UK. I researched type history, figures, faces, and foundries that were part of Londonâ€™s typographic legacy from early printing to contemporary
                        design. </p>

                    <p>This is the result of my research: a graphic timeline of typefaces, separated by classification. The timeline is in the form of a subway map, inspired by the early London Underground map designed by Harry Beck. The map itself
                        is enclosed in a pamphlet, making it portable. This independent study is the basis of the Exploration of Typography in London course while in London.</p>
