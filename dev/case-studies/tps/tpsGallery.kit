                    <p>In the Fall quarter of 17-18, The Philadelphia School approached the graphic design faculty at Drexel University to rebrand their school. The faculty members saw an opportunity and created a branding class, in which they only
                        had
                        enough time to come up with a successful logo that The Philadelphia School liked. In the Spring 17-18 term, the Drexel faculty decided to finish up the rebrand of the school and created a second class. In that class, my group
                        members and myself came up with this for their new brand identity.</p>
