        <p>It consists of many influences from past great designers, and incorporates The Philadelphia School's amazing
            values. We were influenced by Massimo Vignelli for his use of color overlay, Josef Müller-Brockmann for
            scale change and transparencies, and Armin Hofmann for the extreme scale change in his designs. One of our
            group members
            was in charge of research and she had found the school's diversity statement. We all agreed that the opening
            line of "Come as you are, and we’ll learn from each other." accurately describes the school, and we decided
            that it
            will be our tagline for the rebrand.</p>
