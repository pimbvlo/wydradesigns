            <p>Initially, I did my best to adhere to Fender's guidelines to try and work within it but come up with something fresh. I also as inspired by the British Punk movement and music. After multiple passes and refinements, it was paired down
                to a few simple ideas: fields of color, Fender logo tucked into the corner, but visible enough to be noticeable, and an emphasis on the musicians themselves. This year is the 50th anniversary of the Telecaster, so honoring that as a
                special edition packaging line was the focal point.</p>
