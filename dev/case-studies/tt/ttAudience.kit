        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>Since TikTok has set a minimum age of 18 years old for receiving and giving donations, the audience&#39;s age in
            this study focused on that demographic, as well as a few self-imposed rules. Using my screener survey, I set
            out to find people who are on TikTok at least once every other day. I also searched for those who have
            donated money to Creators, either through TikTok itself or other means such as Venmo, CashApp, Patreon, etc.
