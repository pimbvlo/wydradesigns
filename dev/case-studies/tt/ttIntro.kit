        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Since mid-2017, TikTok has gained explosive popularity globally, but especially in the United States. TikTok
            is one of the world&#39;s most popular social media platforms for short-form (15–60 seconds) video creation and
            sharing. The attraction to TikTok is that anyone can create whatever they&#39;d like, with each video
            potentially becoming someone&#39;s “15 minutes of fame.”</p>
        <p>While conducting research, a pattern arose that most people on the app want a sense of community. That led me
            to TikTok&#39;s Live Stream section. It has the most potential for growth into this conduit for community
            that people crave.</p>
