        <h2>Outcomes and Lessons</h2>
        <p>Based on what I had learned, my assumption that friendliness would play a big role in the likelihood of
            someone to donate was validated. Most participants said that the ease of use as well as the “vibe” they got
            would make them more likely to donate to Creators. My personal bias points that towards the heavily rounded
            corners and large colorful illustrations. By taking these factors into consideration, participants felt a
            greater sense of community through the enhanced interaction with the redesigned flow for Viewers to donate
            to Content Creators.</p>
