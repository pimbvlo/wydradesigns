        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Based on preliminary research, there was a clear lack of community between Content Creators and Viewers that
            both user types very much craved. So, the problem I set out to solve was: <strong>how to rethink TikTok&#39;s Live
                Stream functionality so that there&#39;s better engagement between Content Creators and their Viewers.</strong>
            Currently, the only form of engagement on Live Streams relies solely on comments and a basic form of
            donations to the Content Creator streaming. Depending on the popularity of the Creator and how many people
            are watching the stream, the comments section usually is filled up with Viewers asking questions or just
            trying to get the Content Creator to give them a shoutout.</p>
        <p>An alternative way to give the comments section a brief pause is to donate to the Content Creator because
            they will see that and generally thank whoever donates to them, especially when it comes to higher-priced
            donations.</p>
