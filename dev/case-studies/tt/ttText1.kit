            <p>I set the museumâ€™s brand apart from others in the area through the use of duotone imagery, headline text that weaves in and out of the photographs and the places in which advertisements appeared. I was inspired by their rich archive of
                science related imagery and graphics, as well as duotone imagery with layered text. Their archives include diagrams, advertisements, photographs, and portraits dating all the way back to the 1440's. Looking through their archive, I
                realized how underutilized it was throughout the museum and their brochures and magazines. </p>
