                    <p>This assignment was to design a poster inspired by a short story. I was given Likable by Deb Olin Unferth, a story told in the third person. It was as if the narrator was so self-conscious that she couldn't tell her own story
                        herself. The interspersed questions throughout the story felt as though it was a rabbit hole of thoughts that the narrator was stuck on. I took the idea of
                        the repetitive thoughts to the fullest extent.</p>
