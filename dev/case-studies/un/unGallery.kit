                    <p>This assignment was to design a poster inspired by a short story. I was given Likable by Deb Olin Unferth, and the story seemed to be told in the third person, but from the perspective of the narrator. It was as if the narrator
                        was so self-conscious that she couldn't tell her story herself. The interspersed questions throughout the story felt as though it was a rabbit hole of thoughts that the narrator was stuck on. I took the idea of
                        the repetitive thoughts to the fullest extent.</p>
